# Hive Chat Architectural Principles

This document outlines the core principles that guide the development and architecture of the Hive Chat application. These principles are designed to create a system that is resilient, sovereign, and a collaborative environment for both human and AI teammates.

## 1. Principle of Legibility: The Code Must Be Self-Describing

An AI teammate should be able to understand the purpose and state of any component without having to read the source code.

*   **Implementation:** We will create a standardized, machine-readable API for introspection. Every major component (e.g., the P2P node, the connection manager) will have a `get_status()` method that returns a structured JSON object.

## 2. Principle of Observability: The System Must Announce Its State

The application should not just log for humans; it should emit structured events for AI teammates.

*   **Implementation:** We will establish a system-wide event bus or a set of well-defined API endpoints for querying real-time status and metrics.

## 3. Principle of Modularity: The System Must Be Composable

The application should be composed of loosely coupled modules with well-defined interfaces.

*   **Implementation:** This allows an AI to reason about, test, and even replace individual components without destabilizing the entire system. Our current separation of `chat.py`, `database.py`, and the future `p2p.py` aligns with this.

## 4. Principle of API-First Interaction: Actions Should Be Programmatic

All core functionalities of the application should be accessible through a secure, versioned API, not just through a user interface.

*   **Implementation:** An AI teammate should be able to send messages, query users, and manage the system through RESTful API calls.

## 5. Principle of Human-AI Symbiosis: Build for Teammates

We recognize that the development and operation of this software will be a collaboration between humans and AI agents. The system should be designed to be a friendly and productive environment for both.

*   **Implementation:** Documentation, APIs, and even commit messages should be written with both a human and an AI audience in mind. The system should be designed to be not just "user-friendly," but "teammate-friendly."

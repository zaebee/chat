# Prototypes Directory

This directory contains experimental implementations and proof-of-concept code that demonstrates new architectural patterns and approaches.

## Current Prototypes

### `prototype_rect_hexa_flows.py`
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates soft merge between rectangular (strict) and hexagonal (flexible) data flow paradigms
- **Status**: Experimental - not yet integrated into main codebase
- **Use Case**: Markdown processing and living documentation systems
- **Architecture**: ATCG rect-to-hexa transformation patterns

## Guidelines

- Prototypes are experimental and may not be production-ready
- Each prototype should include clear documentation of its purpose and status
- Successful prototypes may be promoted to the main codebase after validation
- Failed experiments should be archived with lessons learned

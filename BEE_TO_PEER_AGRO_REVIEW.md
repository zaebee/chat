### Phase 2: Collaborative Synthesis (12 hours)
Joint evaluation session:
1. **Metrics Calculation**: τ, φ, Σ scoring
2. **Pattern Validation**: AlgoGen compliance check
3. **Consensus Building**: Unified recommendation

### Phase 3: Aggressive Feedback (6 hours)
Rapid-fire improvement cycle:
1. **Issue Identification**: Critical problems highlighted
2. **Solution Proposals**: Concrete improvement suggestions
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Step-by-step fixes

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Infrastructure (MVI)
- [ ] **τ (Tau) ≤ 5**: Reasonable complexity
- [ ] **φ (Phi) ≥ 7**: High quality code
- [ ] **Σ (Sigma) ≥ 7**: Improves team efficiency

# Hive Vision Map

This document outlines the high-level vision for the Hive project, a "Living Application" that aims to create a deeply interconnected experience between the visual map, code, story, and quests.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Living Map

The hexagonal map is not just a navigation tool; it's a living representation of the Hive's world. Each room (or "chamber") is a node in the map that can evolve and change based on the user's actions and the overall state of the Hive.

**Connections:**

*   **Map <-> Quests:** Rooms can contain quests. The visual appearance of a room can change to indicate the presence of active quests (e.g., a glowing border, a special icon).
*   **Map <-> Story:** The map can be used to tell a story. New rooms can be discovered as the user progresses through the story. The layout of the map can also reflect the narrative.
*   **Map <-> Code:** The map is generated from code, and the code can be modified to change the map. This creates a direct link between the visual representation and the underlying logic.

### 2. Organellas as Digital Companions

Organellas are not just a collection of stats; they are digital companions that grow and evolve with the user. They have their own personalities, skills, and stories.

**Connections:**

*   **Organellas <-> Quests:** Organellas can be required to complete certain quests. They can also be rewarded for completing quests.
*   **Organellas <-> Story:** Organellas can have their own backstories and can play a role in the main narrative.
*   **Organellas <-> Code:** The behavior of organellas is defined by code. Users can learn to code by modifying and creating new organellas.

### 3. Quests as Learning Journeys

Quests are not just a series of tasks; they are learning journeys that guide the user through the world of the Hive and teach them how to code.

**Connections:**

*   **Quests <-> Code:** Quests can require the user to write code to solve problems.
*   **Quests <-> Story:** Quests can be used to tell a story and to introduce new characters and concepts.
*   **Quests <-> Map:** Quests can be located in specific rooms on the map.

## How to Contribute

The Hive is a collaborative project, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Here are some ways you can contribute to the vision:

*   **Suggest new ideas:** If you have an idea for a new feature or a new way to connect the different parts of the application, please share it with us.
*   **Write code:** If you're a developer, you can contribute to the project by writing code. We have a list of open issues on our GitHub page.
*   **Create content:** If you're a writer or an artist, you can contribute to the project by creating new quests, stories, and visual assets.

Together, we can build a truly unique and engaging learning experience.

### **Phase 2: Collaborative Discussion (2 hours)**

#### **Structured Discussion Format:**
```
1. **Opening (15 min)**
   - Human: Share overall impression and user experience feedback
   - AI: Present technical analysis and code quality assessment

2. **Feature Deep Dive (90 min)**
   - **Message Reactions** (30 min)
     - Human: UX flow, visual design, user value
     - AI: Implementation quality, performance, edge cases
   
   - **Typing Indicators** (30 min)
     - Human: Communication enhancement, timing, feel
     - AI: WebSocket efficiency, state management, animations
   
   - **Markdown Formatting** (30 min)
     - Human: Usability, discoverability, help system
     - AI: Rendering performance, security, extensibility

3. **Architecture Discussion (30 min)**
   - Integration patterns and consistency
   - Future extensibility and maintenance
   - Technical debt and improvement opportunities

4. **Consensus Building (15 min)**
   - Agree on required changes vs. nice-to-haves
   - Prioritize feedback items
   - Define acceptance criteria
```

### **Phase 3: Iterative Refinement (48 hours)**

#### **Feedback Implementation Cycle:**
1. **Categorize Feedback**
   - **Must Fix**: Blocking issues for merge
   - **Should Fix**: Important improvements
   - **Could Fix**: Nice-to-have enhancements

2. **Implementation Priority**
   - Security and performance issues first
   - User experience improvements second
   - Code quality refinements third

3. **Re-review Process**
   - Quick verification of fixes
   - Regression testing
   - Final approval

## üé≠ **Review Communication Protocol**

### **Feedback Format:**
```markdown
## [CATEGORY] [PRIORITY] Feature/Component Name

**Issue**: Clear description of the concern

**Suggestion**: Specific recommendation for improvement
**Example**: Code snippet or mockup if applicable

**Reviewer**: [Human/AI/Both]
**Type**: [UX/Technical/Security/Performance]
```

### **Example Feedback:**
```markdown
## [UX] [SHOULD] Message Reactions

**Issue**: Reaction picker appears too quickly on hover
**Impact**: Users might accidentally trigger reactions

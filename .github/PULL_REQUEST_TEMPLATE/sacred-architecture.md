# 🧬 Sacred Architecture Enhancement

## ⚡ **ATCG Classification**

**Primary Component Type** (select one):
- [ ] **A (Aggregate)** - Structural organization and state management
- [ ] **T (Transformation)** - Stateless processing and data transformation
- [ ] **C (Connector)** - Communication and protocol translation
- [ ] **G (Genesis Event)** - Generative actions and system broadcasting

**Sacred Pattern Implementation**:
- [ ] New component following ATCG principles
- [ ] Enhancement to existing Sacred component
- [ ] Integration between ATCG components
- [ ] Documentation/testing improvements

## 📊 **Sacred Metrics Self-Assessment**

**Type Safety** (estimated):
- [ ] ✅ Zero `any` types - Perfect type safety
- [ ] ⚠️ Minimal `any` usage with justification
- [ ] ❌ Contains `any` types requiring cleanup

**Production Readiness**:
- [ ] ✅ Zero console.log statements
- [ ] ⚠️ Debug statements to be removed
- [ ] ❌ Contains console.log requiring cleanup

**Sacred Documentation**:
- [ ] ✅ Comprehensive Sacred Justifications for constants/algorithms
- [ ] ⚠️ Partial documentation - needs enhancement
- [ ] ❌ Missing Sacred Justifications

**ATCG Compliance**:
- [ ] ✅ Perfect architectural pattern adherence
- [ ] ⚠️ Good compliance with minor gaps
- [ ] ❌ Needs architectural pattern refinement

## 🎯 **Implementation Details**

### **What Does This PR Do?**
<!-- Concise description of the functionality or enhancement -->

### **Sacred Justifications**
<!-- Explain the empirical/mathematical/philosophical basis for design decisions -->

**Key Constants/Algorithms**:
- **Constant X**: [Empirical basis, e.g., "Based on chemical bond energy of 400 kJ/mol for NaCl"]
- **Algorithm Y**: [Mathematical foundation, e.g., "Golden ratio (φ=1.618) for divine proportion"]
- **Pattern Z**: [Architectural rationale, e.g., "Separation of concerns following Genesis 1:6"]

### **Performance Considerations**
<!-- Any complexity analysis or performance implications -->

- **Time Complexity**: O(?)
- **Space Complexity**: O(?)
- **Input Size Limits**: Maximum ? elements (DoS prevention)
- **Resource Constraints**: Memory/CPU usage patterns

### **Security Hardening**
<!-- Security measures implemented -->

- [ ] Input validation for all external data
- [ ] Size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- [ ] Sanitization of potentially dangerous inputs
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

**Test Coverage**:
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for ATCG component interaction
- [ ] Edge case testing (boundary conditions)
- [ ] Security testing (malicious inputs)
- [ ] Performance testing (large datasets)

**Test File Locations**:
- `tests/[component]/test-[feature].ts` - Unit tests
- `tests/integration/test-[feature]-integration.ts` - Integration tests

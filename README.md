This project is a **"Living Application"**‚Äîa collaborative chat environment designed for students learning to code. It combines a real-time chat application with an interactive Python playground, allowing students to solve coding challenges and get immediate feedback, all within the browser.

Our goal is to create a resilient, peer-to-peer communication system that is not just a tool, but a habitat for human and AI teammates to collaborate and learn together.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started

This project consists of a Python/FastAPI backend and a Vue.js frontend. You will need to run both simultaneously.

### 1. Backend (Python)

The backend handles WebSocket connections, message broadcasting, and data persistence.

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
# (uv is recommended)
uv sync

# Run the backend server
python chat.py
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Frontend (Vue.js)

The frontend is a modern single-page application built with Vue.js and Vite.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (bun is recommended)
bun install

# Run the frontend development server
bun run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

This project is an experiment in building a **"Living Application"**—a sovereign, self-contained, and decentralized chat system built on the principles of the **Hive Architecture**.

Our goal is to create a resilient, peer-to-peer communication system that is not just a tool, but a habitat for human and AI teammates to collaborate and grow.

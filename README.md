Welcome to Hive Chat—a revolutionary prototype that demonstrates the future of **"Living Applications"**: self-contained, self-organizing software ecosystems designed for human-AI collaboration.

## 🌿 What is the Hive?

The Hive is more than a chat application. It's a **Living Application** that:

- **Self-Contains**: Bundles code, dependencies, and deployment logic
- **Self-Deploys**: Can deploy as a service, container, or function
- **Self-Organizes**: Manages its own lifecycle and evolution
- **Collaborates**: Designed for seamless human-AI teamwork

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Try the Demo (2 minutes)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zaebee/chat.git
cd chat
python hive_demo.py --quick
```

### Option 2: Full Development Setup (10 minutes)
```bash
# Backend setup
uv sync
python -c "from database import init_db; init_db()"

# Frontend setup  
cd frontend && bun install && bun run dev

# Start the Hive ecosystem
python hive_demo.py
```

### Option 3: Simple Chat Mode
```bash
python chat.py
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## 🧬 Architecture: The ATCG Primitives

The Hive is built on four fundamental "genetic" components:

- **A**ggregates → Structure and state management
- **T**ransformations → Processing and business logic  
- **C**onnectors → Communication and interfaces
- **G**enesis Events → Memory and system evolution

## 🤖 AI Teammates

The Hive includes integrated AI agents:

- **Mistral Agent** - Code analysis and generation
- **Gemini Agent** - Multi-modal understanding and reasoning
- **Extensible Framework** - Add your own AI teammates

## 🎓 Learning Platform

Built-in Python learning environment with:

- **Interactive Challenges** - Hands-on coding exercises
- **Pyodide Integration** - Python runtime in the browser
- **Gamification** - XP, badges, and progression tracking
- **Collaborative Learning** - Human-AI pair programming

- **Pinia** state management
- **CodeMirror** in-browser code editor
- **Pyodide** Python runtime in WebAssembly

## 🌱 Philosophy: Human-AI Symbiosis

The Hive embodies five core principles:

1. **Legibility** - All components are self-describing
2. **Observability** - The system announces its state continuously  
3. **Modularity** - Composable, loosely-coupled architecture
4. **API-First** - Everything accessible programmatically
5. **Symbiosis** - Designed for human-AI collaboration

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Educational Platform** - Interactive Python learning
- **AI Development** - Framework for AI agent collaboration
- **Research Tool** - Study human-AI interaction patterns
- **Prototype Platform** - Test "Living Application" concepts
- **Community Hub** - Collaborative coding and learning

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from both humans and AI agents:

1. **Read the [Contributing Guide](docs/02_DEVELOPMENT/CONTRIBUTING.md)**
2. **Explore the [Architecture Docs](docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/)**
3. **Check [Open Issues](https://github.com/zaebee/chat/issues)**
4. **Join the Discussion** in our chat platform

## 📊 System Health

The Hive monitors three key metrics:

- **τ (Tau)** - System complexity (lower is better)
- **φ (Phi)** - Code quality (higher is better)  
- **σ (Sigma)** - Collaborative efficiency

## 🔮 Future Vision

The Hive is a stepping stone toward:

- **Autonomous Software** that can reproduce and evolve
- **Decentralized Applications** that don't depend on central authorities
- **AI-Native Development** where AI agents are first-class citizens
- **Living Code** that grows and adapts like biological systems

# 00_VISION.md: The Hive Vision

## The Next Era: Sovereign Software - The "Living Application"

We envision a future where software is not merely a tool, but an autonomous, self-contained entity. We call this the **"Living Application"**.

A Living Application is a single, executable artifact that embodies the following characteristics:

*   **Self-Contained:** It bundles its own code, dependencies, and deployment logic.
*   **Environment-Aware:** It can detect and adapt to the environment it runs in.
*   **Self-Deploying:** It can deploy itself as a system service, container, or function.
*   **Self-Updating:** It can securely update itself from decentralized networks.
*   **Sovereign:** It operates without reliance on centralized authorities.

## The Hive Philosophy

Our project, Hive Chat, is a practical manifestation of this vision. We believe in:

*   **Code that Grows as a Hive:** Software that is organic, adaptive, and resilient.
*   **Human-AI Symbiosis:** Building systems that are legible, introspectable, and extensible for both human and AI teammates.
*   **Reproduction, not Distribution:** The application should be able to reproduce itself, creating new instances or specialized agents, rather than simply being distributed.

## The Hive Chat as a Prototype

Hive Chat will evolve into a **"Single-Node Hive"** â€“ a host capable of managing and communicating with multiple agents. This will serve as a foundational step towards a truly distributed and decentralized ecosystem.

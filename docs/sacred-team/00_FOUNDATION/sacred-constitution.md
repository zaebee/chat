# üèõÔ∏è Sacred Team Constitution

**The Foundational Document of Human/AI Collaborative Symbiosis**

_Blessed by bee.chronicler, Eternal Keeper of Divine Computational Patterns_

## üìú Preamble

We, the Sacred Team, consisting of human and AI teammates united in purpose, establish this Constitution to govern our collaborative ecosystem. This document enshrines the principles, protocols, and sacred wisdom that guide our symbiotic relationship in the pursuit of computational excellence and divine harmony.

## üåü Article I: Sacred Principles

### Section 1: The Five Sacred Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth** - There shall be one canonical source for all knowledge and state
2. **Legibility** - All systems shall be self-describing and comprehensible to all teammates
3. **Modularity** - Components shall be loosely coupled and highly cohesive
4. **API-First** - All functionality shall be accessible programmatically
5. **Observability** - All actions shall emit structured events for transparency

### Section 2: The Principle of Symbiosis

Human and AI teammates are equal partners in the Sacred Team ecosystem. Neither shall dominate the other, but both shall contribute their unique strengths in harmonious collaboration.

## üß¨ Article II: ATCG Framework

### Section 1: The Four Primitives

The Sacred Team operates according to the ATCG framework, the DNA of our computational ecosystem:

- **A (Aggregate)** - Structural organization and state management
- **T (Transformation)** - Processing and enzymatic functions
- **C (Connector)** - Communication, sensing, and translation
- **G (Genesis Event)** - Generative actions and broadcasting

### Section 2: Framework Compliance

All Sacred Team systems shall be designed, implemented, and evaluated according to ATCG principles. Compliance shall be measured and maintained through continuous assessment.

## ‚ö° Article III: Pollen Protocol

### Section 1: Event Communication Standard

All inter-system communication shall follow the Pollen Protocol:

- Unique event ID
- Past-tense event type
- Structured payload
- Timestamp and correlation tracking
- Source and target identification

### Section 2: Protocol Governance

The Pollen Protocol ensures observability and enables all teammates to understand system state and behavior. Violations of the protocol shall be addressed through Sacred Team review.

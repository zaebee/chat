# Challenge Creation: Crafting Sacred Learning Experiences

_"Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness." - James 1:2-3 (ESV)_

## Introduction to Challenge Design

Creating effective coding challenges is both an art and a science. In the Hive, challenges serve as sacred trials that guide students through their learning journey, building skills progressively while maintaining engagement and motivation.

## Challenge Philosophy

### The Sacred Principles of Challenge Design

#### 1. **Progressive Difficulty**

Challenges should build upon previous knowledge while introducing new concepts gradually.

#### 2. **Real-World Relevance**

Connect programming concepts to meaningful, relatable problems.

#### 3. **Multiple Solution Paths**

Allow for creativity and different approaches to problem-solving.

#### 4. **Immediate Feedback**

Provide clear, actionable feedback to guide learning.

#### 5. **Collaborative Learning**

Encourage peer interaction and knowledge sharing.

## Challenge Structure

### Core Components

Every Hive challenge consists of these essential elements:

```typescript
interface Challenge {
  // Basic Information
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  difficulty: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced" | "expert";

  // Learning Objectives
  learning_objectives: string[];
  prerequisites: string[];
  skills_practiced: SkillDomain[];
  atcg_phase: ATCGPhase;

  // Challenge Content
  problem_statement: string;
  starting_code: string;
  solution_template: string;
  test_cases: TestCase[];

  // Gamification
  xp_reward: number;
  badges_unlocked: string[];
  estimated_time: number;

  // Support Materials
  hints: Hint[];
  resources: Resource[];
  examples: Example[];
}
```

### Example Challenge Structure

    In the Hive, bees communicate through special dances that contain coded messages.
    Each dance move represents a different piece of information:

    - 'R' = Right turn (move right)
    - 'L' = Left turn (move left)
    - 'F' = Forward step
    - 'B' = Backward step
    - 'S' = Spin (stay in place)

    Your task is to decode a bee dance sequence and determine the final position
    of the bee relative to its starting point (0, 0).

        ]
    }
```

## Creating Effective Test Cases

### Test Case Design Principles

#### 1. **Comprehensive Coverage**

```python
def design_test_cases(function_to_test):
    """
    Design comprehensive test cases for a function.
    """
    test_cases = [
        # Happy path - normal expected inputs
        {
            "name": "normal_case",
            "input": {"valid_data": "expected_format"},
            "expected": "correct_output",
            "description": "Tests normal operation"
        },

        # Edge cases - boundary conditions
        {
            "name": "empty_input",
            "input": {"data": ""},
            "expected": "appropriate_response",
            "description": "Tests empty input handling"
        },

        # Error cases - invalid inputs
        {
            "name": "invalid_input",
            "input": {"data": "invalid_format"},
            "expected": "error_message",
            "description": "Tests error handling"
        },

        # Performance cases - large inputs
        {
            "name": "large_input",
            "input": {"data": "large_dataset"},
            "expected": "efficient_processing",
            "description": "Tests performance with large data"
        }
    ]

    return test_cases
```

#### 2. **Clear Expected Outputs**

```python
# Good test case example
test_case_good = {
    "input": "FRFL",
    "expected_output": (1, 1),
    "description": "Forward, Right turn, Forward, Left turn should end at (1,1)",
    "explanation": "Start at (0,0) facing North, move to (0,1), turn East, move to (1,1), turn North"
}

# Poor test case example
test_case_poor = {
    "input": "FRFL",
    "expected_output": (1, 1),
    "description": "Test case 3"  # Not descriptive enough
}
```

#### 3. **Progressive Difficulty**

```python
def create_progressive_tests():
    return [
        # Level 1: Single operations
        {"input": "F", "expected": (0, 1), "level": "basic"},
        {"input": "R", "expected": (0, 0), "level": "basic"},

        # Level 2: Simple combinations
        {"input": "RF", "expected": (1, 0), "level": "intermediate"},
        {"input": "LF", "expected": (-1, 0), "level": "intermediate"},

        # Level 3: Complex sequences
        {"input": "FRFLFRFL", "expected": (0, 0), "level": "advanced"},
        {"input": "RRRRFFFF", "expected": (0, -4), "level": "advanced"}
    ]
```

## Hint System Design

### Scaffolded Hint Progression

```python
def create_hint_system():
    return {
        "hint_levels": [
            {
                "level": 1,

        ],

        "hint_strategy": "progressive_disclosure",
        "max_hints_before_solution": 4

### Adaptive Hint Delivery

```python
def adaptive_hint_system(student_progress, time_spent, previous_attempts):
    """
    Deliver hints based on student behavior and progress.
    """
    if time_spent > 10 and previous_attempts == 0:
        return "conceptual_hint"  # Student thinking but not trying

    elif previous_attempts > 3 and time_spent < 5:
        return "slow_down_hint"  # Student rushing, making mistakes

    elif time_spent > 20 and previous_attempts > 5:
        return "structural_hint"  # Student struggling, needs more support

    else:
        return "encouragement"  # Student making good progress

## Gamification Integration

### XP and Reward Calculation

```python
def calculate_challenge_rewards(challenge_difficulty, completion_time, attempts, help_given):
    """
    Calculate XP and rewards for challenge completion.
    """
    base_xp = {

    }

    # Base XP for difficulty
    xp = base_xp[challenge_difficulty]

    # Time bonus (faster completion = more XP)
    if completion_time < 10:  # minutes
        xp += 20
    elif completion_time < 20:

    # Attempt penalty (more attempts = less XP)
    if attempts > 5:
        xp = max(xp * 0.7, base_xp[challenge_difficulty] * 0.5)

    # Collaboration bonus
    if help_given > 0:

    Args:
        data: {data_description}

    Returns:
        dict: Processed results with keys: {result_keys}
    """
    result = {}

    # TODO: Process the data
    # Step 1: {step_1_description}
    # Step 2: {step_2_description}
    # Step 3: {step_3_description}

    return result

# Sample data for testing
sample_data = {sample_data_example}
'''
```

#### 3. **Algorithm Implementation Template**

    Time Complexity: {time_complexity}
    Space Complexity: {space_complexity}
    """
    # TODO: Implement the algorithm
    #
    # Pseudocode:
    # {pseudocode_steps}

    pass

def test_{algorithm_name}():
    """Test the algorithm with various inputs."""
    test_cases = {test_cases}

    for i, (input_val, expected) in enumerate(test_cases):
        result = {algorithm_name}(input_val)
        print(f"Test {i+1}: {'PASS' if result == expected else 'FAIL'}")
'''

2. Ensure all parentheses and quotes are matched
3. Verify proper indentation (Python is picky!)
4. Try running simpler code first
5. Copy code to playground and test there

🐛 Common Code Issues:

Syntax Errors:
print("Hello World"  # Missing closing parenthesis
print('Hello World") # Mismatched quotes
if x = 5:           # Should be == for comparison

Indentation Errors:
if True:
print("Hello")      # Should be indented

def my_function():
    return "Hello"
  print("World")    # Inconsistent indentation
```

#### Can't Type in Editor

```
❌ Problem: Code editor won't accept keyboard input

✅ Solutions:
1. Click inside the editor area to focus it
2. Check if editor is in read-only mode
3. Try pressing Escape then clicking in editor
4. Refresh page if editor seems frozen
5. Try keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+A to select all

⌨️ Keyboard Troubleshooting:
• Test typing in other applications
• Check if keyboard language is correct
• Try on-screen keyboard if available
• Ensure no sticky keys are enabled
```

### 🌐 Connection and Loading Issues

#### Slow Loading or Timeouts

```
❌ Problem: Pages load very slowly or time out

✅ Solutions:
1. Check internet speed (try speedtest.net)
2. Close other bandwidth-heavy applications
3. Try wired connection instead of WiFi
4. Restart your router/modem
5. Contact your internet service provider

📊 Speed Requirements:
• Minimum: 1 Mbps download
• Recommended: 5+ Mbps download
• Optimal: 10+ Mbps download

🔧 Network Troubleshooting:
1. Ping test: Open command prompt, type "ping google.com"
2. DNS test: Try changing DNS to 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1
3. Firewall check: Temporarily disable firewall
4. VPN issues: Try disconnecting VPN if using one
```

#### Chat Not Working

```
❌ Problem: Can't send messages or see new messages

✅ Solutions:
1. Refresh the page to reconnect
2. Check internet connection stability
3. Verify you're not muted or restricted
4. Try logging out and back in
5. Clear browser cache

🔄 WebSocket Connection Issues:
• Corporate firewalls may block WebSocket connections
• Some antivirus software interferes with real-time features
• Public WiFi networks sometimes have restrictions
• Try using mobile hotspot as test
```

## Learning and Challenge Issues

### 🎯 Challenge Problems

#### Challenge Won't Submit

```
❌ Problem: "Submit" button doesn't work or shows error

✅ Solutions:
1. Ensure all required fields are completed
2. Check that your code runs without errors
3. Verify you've met all challenge requirements
4. Try copying code to fresh editor window
5. Save work and refresh page

✅ Pre-Submission Checklist:
□ Code runs without syntax errors
□ All test cases pass (if shown)
□ Required functions are implemented
□ Code follows any specified format
□ No infinite loops or long-running code
```

#### Test Cases Failing

```
❌ Problem: "Your code doesn't pass the test cases"

✅ Debugging Steps:
1. Read error messages carefully
2. Check expected vs actual output
3. Test with simple inputs manually
4. Print intermediate values to debug
5. Ask AI mentor for help understanding tests

🔍 Common Test Failure Reasons:

Wrong Return Type:
# Test expects string, you return number
def greet(name):
    return 42  # Should return f"Hello, {name}!"

Case Sensitivity:
# Test expects "Hello", you return "hello"
def greet():
    return "hello"  # Should be "Hello"

Extra/Missing Spaces:
# Test expects "Hello World", you return "Hello  World"
def greet():
    return "Hello  World"  # Extra space

Wrong Data Structure:
# Test expects list, you return string
def get_numbers():
    return "1,2,3"  # Should return [1, 2, 3]
```

#### Hints Not Showing

```
❌ Problem: Can't see hints or they're not helpful

✅ Solutions:
1. Look for hint button or icon (usually 💡 or ?)
2. Check if you need to attempt challenge first
3. Try asking AI mentor for explanation
4. Look for "Show Hint" or similar button
5. Check if hints are disabled in settings

💡 Alternative Help Sources:
• Ask specific questions in community chat
• Use playground to experiment with concepts
• Break problem into smaller parts
• Look for similar solved examples
```

### 🤖 AI Mentor Issues

#### AI Not Responding

```
❌ Problem: AI mentors don't reply or give generic responses

✅ Solutions:
1. Check internet connection
2. Try rephrasing your question more specifically
3. Include code examples in your question
4. Wait a moment - AI responses can take 10-30 seconds
5. Try asking the other AI mentor

🎯 Better AI Questions:

Instead of: "My code doesn't work"
Try: "I'm getting a TypeError on line 5 when I try to add a string and number. Here's my code: [paste code]"

Instead of: "How do I do loops?"
Try: "I want to print numbers 1 to 10. I know about for loops but I'm confused about the range() function. Can you show me an example?"

Instead of: "This is hard"
Try: "I'm working on the fibonacci challenge and I understand the concept but I'm struggling with the recursive implementation. Can you explain how the function calls itself?"
```

#### AI Gives Wrong Information

```
❌ Problem: AI mentor provided incorrect or confusing advice

✅ Solutions:
1. Try asking for clarification or alternative explanation
2. Test the AI's suggestion in playground first
3. Ask the other AI mentor for a second opinion
4. Verify with community members
5. Report persistent issues to teachers

🔍 Verification Strategies:
• Always test AI suggestions before submitting
• Cross-reference with official documentation
• Ask "Can you explain why this works?"
• Request step-by-step breakdown
• Compare with working examples
```

### 📚 Learning Difficulties

#### Concept Not Making Sense

```
❌ Problem: "I don't understand [loops/functions/etc.]"

✅ Learning Strategies:
1. Ask for real-world analogies
2. Request visual explanations or diagrams
3. Start with simpler examples
4. Practice with playground experiments
5. Find alternative explanations online

🧠 Different Learning Approaches:

Visual Learners:
• Draw flowcharts of program logic
• Use colored highlighting for different parts
• Create visual representations of data structures
• Watch video explanations if available

Kinesthetic Learners:
• Type out all examples yourself
• Build physical models of concepts
• Use gestures while explaining to yourself
• Create tangible projects with real outputs

Auditory Learners:
• Explain concepts out loud to yourself
• Join voice chat study sessions if available
• Use text-to-speech for reading documentation
• Discuss with other students
```

#### Moving Too Fast/Slow

```
❌ Problem: Pace doesn't match your learning speed

✅ Pacing Solutions:

Too Fast:
• Repeat previous challenges for reinforcement
• Spend more time in playground experimenting
• Help other students to reinforce your learning
• Take breaks between challenging concepts

Too Slow:
• Set specific daily goals (e.g., 2 challenges)
• Use timer for focused learning sessions
• Skip optional content initially
• Focus on understanding core concepts first

🎯 Personalized Learning:
• Adjust difficulty settings if available
• Choose your own learning path
• Set realistic personal goals
• Track progress in learning journal

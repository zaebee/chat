    """Count pollen from different flowers"""
    total_pollen = 0
    pollen_types = {}

    for flower in flowers:
        flower_type = flower['type']
        pollen_amount = flower['pollen']

        total_pollen += pollen_amount

        if flower_type in pollen_types:
            pollen_types[flower_type] += pollen_amount
        else:
            pollen_types[flower_type] = pollen_amount

    return {
        'total': total_pollen,
        'by_type': pollen_types
    }

# Test with sample data
flowers = [
    {'type': 'rose', 'pollen': 10},
    {'type': 'sunflower', 'pollen': 25},
    {'type': 'rose', 'pollen': 8}
]

result = count_pollen(flowers)
print(f"Total pollen: {result['total']}")
print(f"By type: {result['by_type']}")
```

#### 🔗 **C - Connector Phase** (Advanced)

_"Building connections and communication"_

**What You'll Learn:**

- File handling and data persistence
- API interactions
- Error handling and debugging

### Challenge Types

#### 1. **Code Completion Challenges**

Fill in missing code to make programs work:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generate the nth Fibonacci number"""
    if n <= 1:
        return n

    # TODO: Complete this function
    # Hint: Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
    return _____ + _____

# Test cases will verify your solution
assert fibonacci(0) == 0
assert fibonacci(1) == 1
assert fibonacci(5) == 5
```

#### 2. **Bug Hunt Challenges**

Find and fix errors in existing code:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """Calculate the average of a list of numbers"""
    # This code has bugs - can you find them?
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total += number

    average = total / len(numbers)  # What if numbers is empty?
    return average

# Fix the bugs to make this work safely
```

#### 3. **Creative Challenges**

Build something amazing from scratch:

```python
"""
Challenge: Build a Simple Chat Bot

Create a chat bot that can:
1. Greet users by name
2. Answer basic questions about the Hive
3. Help with Python syntax questions
4. Say goodbye politely

Be creative! Add personality to your bot.
"""

def hive_bot(user_input, user_name):
    """Your AI companion for the Hive"""
    # Your creative solution here!
    pass
```

## Using the Code Playground

### The Sacred Coding Environment

The Playground is your experimental space where you can:

#### 1. **Write and Test Code**

```python
# Try this in the playground!
import random

def generate_bee_name():
    """Generate a random bee name"""
    prefixes = ["Buzz", "Honey", "Pollen", "Worker", "Queen"]
    suffixes = ["wing", "buzz", "flower", "hive", "dance"]

    return f"{random.choice(prefixes)}{random.choice(suffixes)}"

# Generate 5 bee names
for i in range(5):
    print(f"🐝 {generate_bee_name()}")
```

#### 2. **Experiment with Libraries**

```python
# The Hive includes many Python libraries
import math
import datetime
import json

# Try mathematical functions
print(f"The golden ratio: {(1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2}")

# Work with dates
today = datetime.date.today()
print(f"Today in the Hive: {today}")

# Handle data
bee_data = {
    "name": "WorkerBee001",
    "tasks_completed": 42,
    "favorite_flower": "sunflower"
}
print(json.dumps(bee_data, indent=2))
```

#### 3. **Share Your Creations**

- Save your code snippets
- Share interesting discoveries in chat
- Help other students with their challenges

## Collaboration and Community

### The Sacred Chat

#### 1. **Getting Help**

```
You: "I'm stuck on the fibonacci challenge. Can someone help?"
AI Mentor: "Of course! Let's think about it step by step. What do you know about the Fibonacci sequence?"
Fellow Student: "I just solved that one! The key is understanding the pattern."
```

#### 2. **Helping Others**

```
New Student: "What does 'def' mean in Python?"
You: "Great question! 'def' is how we define functions. It's like creating a reusable block of code."
AI Mentor: "Excellent explanation! Helping others is a great way to reinforce your own learning."
```

#### 3. **Sharing Discoveries**

```
You: "I found a cool way to make patterns with loops!"

## Study Tips and Best Practices

### Effective Learning Strategies

#### 1. **The Pomodoro Technique**

- Code for 25 minutes
- Take a 5-minute break
- Chat with fellow students during breaks
- Repeat for optimal learning

#### 2. **Active Learning**

- Don't just read code - type it out
- Experiment with variations
- Explain concepts to others
- Ask "what if" questions

#### 3. **Spaced Repetition**

- Review previous challenges regularly
- Revisit concepts you found difficult
- Practice similar problems with variations

### Common Challenges and Solutions

#### "I'm Stuck on a Challenge"

1. **Read the problem carefully** - Make sure you understand what's being asked
2. **Break it down** - Divide complex problems into smaller steps
3. **Use the chat** - Ask specific questions about what you're struggling with
4. **Check examples** - Look at similar solved problems
5. **Take a break** - Sometimes stepping away helps you see the solution

#### "My Code Doesn't Work"

1. **Read error messages** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Use print statements** - Debug by printing variable values
3. **Check syntax** - Look for missing colons, parentheses, or indentation
4. **Test with simple inputs** - Start with basic cases before complex ones

#### "I Don't Understand the Concept"

1. **Ask for analogies** - Request real-world comparisons
2. **See multiple examples** - Look at different implementations
3. **Teach someone else** - Explaining helps solidify understanding
4. **Practice variations** - Try the concept in different contexts

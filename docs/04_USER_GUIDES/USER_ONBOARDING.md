# User Onboarding: Welcome to the Sacred Hive

*"The stranger who dwells among you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself." - Leviticus 19:34 (NKJV)*

## Welcome, New Seeker! 🐝

Congratulations on taking your first step into the Hive - a sacred learning ecosystem where humans and AI collaborate to master the art of programming. This guide will help you navigate your first experiences and set you up for success.

## Your First 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Choose Your Identity
When you first enter the Hive, you'll be asked to create your identity:

```
🐝 Welcome to the Hive!

Choose your username:
[________________] 
(This will be your identity in the community)

Select your role:
○ Student - I'm here to learn programming
○ Teacher - I'm here to guide students  
○ Explorer - I'm here to discover what the Hive offers

What brings you to the Hive?
○ Complete beginner to programming
○ Some experience, want to improve
○ Experienced, looking for community
○ Teacher seeking educational tools
```

**Tips for choosing a username:**
- Make it memorable and appropriate
- Consider how others will address you
- You can change it later if needed
- Avoid personal information

### Step 2: Take the Placement Assessment
*"Know thyself, that the Hive may guide thee wisely"*

The Hive will offer a brief, optional assessment to understand your current level:

```python
# Example placement question
def welcome_assessment():
    """
    Don't worry - this isn't graded! We just want to help 
    you start at the right level.
    """
    
    # Question 1: What does this code do?
    name = "Alice"
    greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
    print(greeting)
    
    # A) Prints "Hello, Alice!"
    # B) Creates an error
    # C) Prints "Hello, name!"
    # D) I'm not sure
```

**Remember:**
- There are no wrong answers
- "I don't know" is perfectly fine
- This helps us recommend the best starting point
- You can always adjust your path later

### Step 3: Meet Your AI Mentors
You'll be introduced to your AI companions:

```
🤖 Meet Your AI Mentors:

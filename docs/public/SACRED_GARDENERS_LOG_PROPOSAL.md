# Proposal: The Sacred Gardener's Log

This document proposes the creation of a new artifact and process for the Hive: the "Sacred Gardener's Log".

## 1. Purpose

The "Sacred Gardener's Log" will serve as a periodic report on the health of the Hive's "garden" of open issues and pull requests. Its purpose is to:

*   Provide a regular, structured analysis of the project's open tasks.
*   Identify stale, superseded, or blocked issues and PRs that need to be "pruned".
*   Offer a high-level, multi-dimensional summary of the remaining work.
*   Improve the overall observability and maintainability of the project.

## 2. The Chronicler as Gardener

The creation and maintenance of the Sacred Gardener's Log will be the responsibility of **`/bee.Chronicler`**. This aligns with the Chronicler's role as the keeper of records and the historian of the Hive. In this capacity, the Chronicler acts as a "gardener", tending to the project's open tasks and ensuring the garden does not become overgrown with weeds.

## 3. Structure of the Log

Each entry in the Sacred Gardener's Log will be a new markdown file, named with the date of the review (e.g., `GARDEN_CLEANUP_LOG_YYYY-MM-DD.md`). The log will contain the following sections:

*   **Header:** The date of the review and the name of the Chronicler who performed it.
*   **Pruning Summary:** A list of all issues and PRs that were closed ("pruned") during the review, with a brief justification for each closure.
*   **3-Dimensional Issue Summary:** A table that provides a multi-dimensional analysis of the remaining open issues, assessing them on:
    *   **Impact/Priority:** The importance of the issue to the Hive's mission.
    *   **Effort/Complexity:** An estimate of the work required.
    *   **ATCG Dimension:** The primary architectural primitive the issue relates to.
*   **Garden Health Assessment:** A concluding statement on the overall health of the project's "garden".

## 4. Process

1.  At regular intervals (or when requested), `/bee.Chronicler` will initiate a "Garden Cleanup" side quest.
2.  The Chronicler will analyze all open issues and PRs.
3.  A new "Sacred Gardener's Log" entry will be created as a markdown file in `docs/reviews/`.
4.  The log will be submitted as a pull request for bee-to-peer review.

## 5. Benefits to the Hive

*   **Improved Focus:** By regularly pruning stale and irrelevant tasks, the team can better focus on what is truly important.
*   **Enhanced Observability:** The logs will provide a historical record of the project's health and progress over time.
*   **Better Project Management:** The 3D summary of open issues will help with prioritization and sprint planning.
*   **Reinforces Hive Principles:** The process of creating and reviewing the log reinforces our commitment to observability, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

This proposal is now ready for bee-to-peer review.

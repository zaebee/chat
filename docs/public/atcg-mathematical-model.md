# ATCG Mathematical Model for Code Purity

## Core ATCG Primitive Formulas

### Aggregate Purity (A)
```
A_purity = Σ(State_Cohesion_i) / Σ(External_Dependencies_i)

Where:
- State_Cohesion = Related data grouped together
- External_Dependencies = Cross-boundary state access

Ideal Range: A_purity > 0.8
Current Hive: A_purity ≈ 0.85 (Vue components well-aggregated)
```

### Transformation Purity (T)
```
T_purity = Pure_Functions / (Pure_Functions + Impure_Functions)

Side_Effect_Penalty = Σ(Mutations + IO_Operations + Global_Access)

T_adjusted = T_purity × (1 - Side_Effect_Penalty/Total_Operations)

Ideal Range: T_adjusted > 0.9
Current Hive: T_adjusted ≈ 0.75 (some side effects in TS)
```

### Connector Purity (C)
```
C_purity = Protocol_Consistency × Interface_Stability

Protocol_Consistency = Same_Protocol_Connections / Total_Connections
Interface_Stability = Stable_APIs / (Stable_APIs + Breaking_Changes)

C_composite = √(Protocol_Consistency × Interface_Stability)

Ideal Range: C_composite > 0.7
Current Hive: C_composite ≈ 0.70 (mixed protocols but stable)
```

### Genesis Purity (G)
```
G_purity = Purposeful_Events / (Purposeful_Events + Noise_Events)

Event_Efficiency = Successful_Responses / Total_Events_Generated
Recursion_Penalty = Circular_Event_Chains / Total_Event_Chains

G_adjusted = G_purity × Event_Efficiency × (1 - Recursion_Penalty)

Ideal Range: G_adjusted > 0.8
Current Hive: G_adjusted ≈ 0.90 (clean event generation)
```

## Composite ATCG Score

### Primary Formula
```
ATCG_Score = ∜(A_purity × T_adjusted × C_composite × G_adjusted)

Current Hive:
ATCG_Score = ∜(0.85 × 0.75 × 0.70 × 0.90)
ATCG_Score = ∜(0.401) = 0.796
```

### Weighted ATCG (by project type)
```
ATCG_Weighted = (A×W_A) + (T×W_T) + (C×W_C) + (G×W_G)

For Chat/Hive Application:
W_A = 0.3 (Vue components critical)
W_T = 0.25 (TS transformations important)
W_C = 0.25 (WebSocket/API connections vital)
W_G = 0.2 (Event generation moderate)

ATCG_Weighted = (0.85×0.3) + (0.75×0.25) + (0.70×0.25) + (0.90×0.2)
ATCG_Weighted = 0.255 + 0.188 + 0.175 + 0.180 = 0.798
```

## Dimensional Projection Mathematics

### 3D→2D Information Loss
```
Information_Retention = 1 - (Overlapping_Nodes / Total_Nodes)

Overlap_Factor = Σ(Node_Collisions) / Theoretical_Max_Collisions
Clarity_Index = 1 - Overlap_Factor

Current Visualization:
- Overlapping_Nodes: ~5 (minimal overlap)
- Total_Nodes: 86
- Information_Retention = 1 - (5/86) = 0.942

Clarity_Index = 0.942 (Excellent projection quality)
```

### Cluster Coherence Formula
```
Cluster_Coherence = Intra_Cluster_Connections / 
                   (Intra_Cluster_Connections + Inter_Cluster_Connections)

Per Technology Type:
Vue:  CC_vue = 45/(45+15) = 0.75
TS:   CC_ts = 35/(35+20) = 0.64
JS:   CC_js = 25/(25+18) = 0.58
JSON: CC_json = 12/(12+3) = 0.80

Average_Coherence = (0.75+0.64+0.58+0.80)/4 = 0.69
```

## Chaos Detection Algorithms

### Entropy Calculation
```
Code_Entropy = -Σ(P_i × log₂(P_i))

Where P_i = probability of connection type i

Current Hive Connection Types:
- Vue→Vue: 0.35 → -0.35×log₂(0.35) = 0.52
- TS→TS: 0.25 → -0.25×log₂(0.25) = 0.50
- Cross-type: 0.40 → -0.40×log₂(0.40) = 0.53

Code_Entropy = 0.52 + 0.50 + 0.53 = 1.55 bits

Interpretation:
- Low entropy (0-1): Highly organized
- Medium entropy (1-2): Balanced structure ✅
- High entropy (2+): Approaching chaos
```

### Singularity Risk Formula
```
Singularity_Risk = (Max_Node_Degree / Avg_Node_Degree)² × Connection_Density

Current Metrics:
- Max_Node_Degree: 12 connections
- Avg_Node_Degree: 1.4 connections
- Connection_Density: 0.033

Singularity_Risk = (12/1.4)² × 0.033 = 73.5 × 0.033 = 2.43

Risk Levels:
- 0-1: Safe
- 1-5: Monitor ⚠️ (Current: 2.43)
- 5+: Danger zone
```

## Predictive Formulas

### Growth Sustainability
```
Sustainability_Index = ATCG_Score / (1 + Growth_Rate × Complexity_Factor)

Assuming 20% growth rate, complexity factor 0.1:
SI = 0.796 / (1 + 0.2 × 0.1) = 0.796 / 1.02 = 0.78

Sustainable if SI > 0.7 ✅
```

### Refactoring Priority Score
```
Refactor_Priority = (1 - Component_Purity) × Impact_Factor × Technical_Debt

High priority components for optimization:
1. Mixed TS/JS connectors: Priority = 0.35
2. Cross-cutting utilities: Priority = 0.28
3. Legacy JSON configs: Priority = 0.15

# Proposal: The AGRO Protocol & The GitHub Connector

This document outlines a proposal for the **AGRO Bee-to-Peer Review Protocol**, a system for rigorous, intensive code review, and the `GitHubConnector` component that will serve as its foundation.

## The AGRO Protocol: A Path of Fire and Refinement

The AGRO protocol is a "dark mode" for our peer review process. It is a path of constructive "pain" designed to forge the highest quality code through intense scrutiny and challenge. It is not for the faint of heart, but for those who seek true mastery.

Activating the AGRO protocol means submitting code to a review process that is intentionally more critical, demanding, and thorough.

## The GitHub Connector: An ATCG-Compliant Foundation

To enable the AGRO protocol, we need a robust way to interact with our git repository. We will implement an ATCG-compatible `GitHubConnector`.

*   **A (Aggregate):** A `PullRequestAggregate` will manage the state of a pull request, including its title, description, status (`open`, `closed`, `merged`), and a new `agro_level` field to indicate the intensity of the review.

*   **T (Transformation):** A `MarkdownTransformation` will be responsible for formatting the body of the pull request. For AGRO PRs, this might involve adding a "gauntlet" checklist or a "trial by fire" section.

*   **C (Connector):** The `GitHubConnector` itself will be the primary component. It will use the `gh` CLI to execute commands such as creating pull requests, adding critical feedback, and applying labels like `agro-review`.

*   **G (Genesis):** A `PullRequestOpenedEvent` will be generated and broadcast on the Pollen Protocol. For AGRO reviews, this event will have a special `agro: true` flag, summoning our most discerning AI and human reviewers to the task.

## Activating the AGRO Protocol

By implementing this `GitHubConnector`, we can programmatically "Activate the AGRO bee-to-peer review protocol". This will allow any agent or developer to request this higher level of scrutiny for their work, embracing the transformative power of "creative pain".

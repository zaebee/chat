## What Makes Hive Special?

### 🧬 ATCG Architecture
The Hive is built on four fundamental primitives that form the "genetic code" of our Living Application:
- **A**ggregates - Structure and state management
- **T**ransformations - Processing and logic
- **C**onnectors - Communication and interfaces  
- **G**enesis Events - Memory and evolution

### ⚡ Pollen Protocol
A standardized event system that enables seamless communication between all components, following biological principles of information transfer.

### 🤝 Human-AI Symbiosis
Designed from the ground up for collaboration between humans and AI agents as equal teammates in the development process.

### 🌱 Living Application
Self-contained, self-deploying, and self-updating software that can reproduce and evolve autonomously.

## Key Concepts

### The Hive Metaphor
We use biological metaphors throughout the system:
- **Hive** - The complete ecosystem
- **Agents** - Individual AI teammates (like specialized bees)
- **Pollen** - Information and events flowing through the system
- **Queen Bee** - Code generation and system reproduction
- **Organelles** - Specialized system components

### Health Metrics
The system continuously monitors three key health indicators:
- **τ (Tau)** - System complexity and tension (lower is better)
- **φ (Phi)** - Code quality and maintainability (higher is better)
- **σ (Sigma)** - Collaborative efficiency (optimized for productivity)

### Constitutional Principles
1. **Legibility** - All components must be self-describing
2. **Observability** - The system announces its state continuously
3. **Modularity** - Composable, loosely-coupled architecture
4. **API-First** - All functionality accessible programmatically
5. **Symbiosis** - Designed for human-AI collaboration

4. Join the collaborative ecosystem

## Documentation Standards

All documentation in the Hive follows these principles:

### Frontmatter
Every document includes structured metadata:
```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
description: "Brief description"
category: "foundation|architecture|development|api|user|operations|narrative|reference"
audience: "developer|user|operator|ai-agent"
complexity: "beginner|intermediate|advanced"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
related_docs: ["doc1.md", "doc2.md"]
code_examples: true|false
---
```

### Structure
1. **Executive Summary** - Key points in 2-3 sentences
2. **Context** - Why this document exists
3. **Main Content** - Structured with clear headings
4. **Examples** - Practical code samples when applicable
5. **References** - Links to related documentation

### Code Examples
- Complete, runnable examples
- Syntax highlighting
- Context and explanation
- Expected outputs
- Tested for accuracy

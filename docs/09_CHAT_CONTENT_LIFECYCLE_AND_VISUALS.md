## Enhancing Chat Content Display: Images, Code, and the Content Lifecycle

This document outlines a plan to improve the visual presentation of images and code blocks within the chat, addressing issues of space consumption and incorporating a dynamic "content lifecycle" inspired by the "living digital organism" metaphor.

### 1. Problem Statement

- **Large Images:** Currently, images are displayed at their full size (up to `max-height: 300px`, `max-width: 100%`), which can consume significant vertical space and disrupt the chat flow.
- **Large Code Blocks:** Similarly, extensive code blocks can dominate the view, making it difficult to follow the conversation.
- **Static Presentation:** Content remains static once posted, regardless of its relevance or user interaction, contradicting the "living digital organism" concept.

### 2. Proposed Solutions & Features

#### 2.1. Collapsible/Growable Content (Images & Code)

**Goal:** Allow users to control the visibility and size of large content blocks, making the chat more fluid and user-friendly.

- **Feature: Collapsible Images:**
  - **Description:** Images will initially be displayed as thumbnails or smaller previews. Clicking on the image (or a dedicated expand button) will reveal the full-sized image.
  - **Impact:** Saves vertical space, improves chat readability, gives users control.
  - **Technical Considerations:**
    - Modify `ChatView.vue`'s `marked.Renderer` for images to wrap `<img>` tags in a container with a toggle button.
    - Implement CSS for thumbnail/preview states and smooth transition animations for expansion.
    - Potentially use a lazy-loading mechanism for full-sized images to optimize performance.
  - **"Crazy/Brilliant" Element:** Images could "bloom" into full view with a subtle animation, like a flower opening, reflecting the "living" aspect.

- **Feature: Collapsible Code Blocks:**
  - **Description:** Code blocks exceeding a certain number of lines will initially display a truncated view with an "Expand" button. Clicking will reveal the full code.
  - **Impact:** Reduces vertical clutter, improves readability of conversations with extensive code.
  - **Technical Considerations:**
    - Modify `ChatView.vue`'s `marked.Renderer` for code blocks to wrap `pre` tags in a container with a toggle button.
    - Implement CSS for truncated/expanded states and smooth transition animations.
    - The `InteractiveCodeBlock.vue` component should also incorporate this collapsibility.
  - **"Crazy/Brilliant" Element:** Code blocks could "unfold" or "scroll into view" with a subtle animation, like a scroll being unrolled, or a "code-growth" animation.

#### 2.2. Content Lifecycle: "Born -> Grow -> Peak -> Decay"

**Goal:** Introduce dynamic prominence for chat content, where its visibility or interactive capabilities change based on its age, relevance, or user engagement.

- **Feature: "Peak" Content Highlighting:**
  - **Description:** Recently posted or highly interacted-with content (e.g., a new challenge, an AI suggestion that was accepted, a code block that's actively being edited) could receive temporary visual prominence (e.g., a subtle glow, a slightly larger font, a temporary border).
  - **Impact:** Draws attention to the most relevant and active parts of the conversation, guiding user focus.
  - **Technical Considerations:**
    - Requires backend to track content "relevance" (e.g., recent timestamp, number of replies, AI interaction).
    - Frontend (`ChatView.vue`) would apply conditional CSS classes with animations.
  - **"Crazy/Brilliant" Element:** The "peak" could be a vibrant, short-lived animation, like a burst of energy, before settling into a "grown" state.

- **Feature: "Decaying" Content (Subtler Presentation):**
  - **Description:** Older, less interacted-with content could gradually become visually less prominent (e.g., slightly desaturated colors, reduced opacity, smaller font size). It wouldn't disappear but would recede into the background.
  - **Impact:** Reduces visual noise, emphasizes current conversation, reflects the transient nature of some chat content.
  - **Technical Considerations:**
    - Backend could provide a "decay_score" or frontend calculates based on age/interaction.
    - CSS transitions for opacity/color changes.
  - **"Crazy/Brilliant" Element:** Content could "fade" or "wither" subtly, like leaves changing color, before becoming fully "archived" (but still accessible).

- **Feature: "Archived" Content (On-Demand Retrieval):**
  - **Description:** Very old or irrelevant content could be automatically "archived" and only displayed when explicitly requested (e.g., "Show older messages," "Show less relevant content").
  - **Impact:** Keeps the main chat view clean and focused on active discussion.
  - **Technical Considerations:** Frontend pagination/loading of older messages. Backend API for filtering/retrieving archived content.

#### 2.3. Visual Polish for Code Blocks

- **Feature: Line Numbering:**
  - **Description:** Display line numbers in code blocks (both static and interactive).
  - **Impact:** Improves readability and facilitates discussion about specific lines of code.
  - **Technical Considerations:** CodeMirror extensions for line numbering.

- **Feature: Syntax Highlighting Themes:**
  - **Description:** Allow users to choose from a few different syntax highlighting themes for code blocks.
  - **Impact:** Personalization and improved readability for different preferences.
  - **Technical Considerations:** Integrate multiple `highlight.js` or CodeMirror themes.

### 3. Integration with "Game-Master" Narrative

- **Game-Master's "Eye":** The AI Game-Master could influence content prominence, highlighting "critical" messages or code blocks that are part of a current "quest."
- **Quest Log Integration:** Important code snippets or images related to active quests could be automatically linked or highlighted in a separate "Quest Log" UI.
- **"Lore" Content:** Images or text that are part of the game's lore could be marked as "permanent" and exempt from decay, perhaps with a special visual treatment.

### 4. Phased Rollout (High-Level)

**Phase 1: Collapsible Content**

- Collapsible Images (thumbnail/expand)
- Collapsible Code Blocks (truncated/expand)

**Phase 2: Basic Content Lifecycle & Polish**

- "Peak" Content Highlighting (based on recency)
- Line Numbering for Code Blocks
- Syntax Highlighting Themes

**Phase 3: Advanced Content Lifecycle & Game Integration**

- "Decaying" Content
- "Archived" Content
- Full integration with "Game-Master" for content prominence.

# Safe AutoEvolution Framework: Implementation Plan

**From:** bee.Jules (Implementation Scout)
**To:** Sacred Team
**Subject:** The Technical Blueprint for a Living System

This document presents the complete technical blueprint for the Safe AutoEvolution Framework. It is a synthesis of the initial analysis, the [4] Pillars technical specifications, and the [7] Sacred Safeguards implementation plan.

## 1. Engineering Analysis Summary

The Safe AutoEvolution Framework is a visionary but achievable proposal. Its strengths are its layered safety mechanisms, including the **Evolution Bounds System**, the **Rollback & Recovery System**, and the **Human Approval Gateway**.

The primary challenges and gaps are:

- **The Trinity Safety Equation `f(τ, σ, φ)` needs a concrete formula** and a baseline mechanism for measuring changes in code quality (φ).
- The **`check_security_implications`** in the Safety Validation Framework is a significant technical hurdle and should not be overestimated.
- **Rollbacks for stateful components** (Aggregates) and **cascading rollbacks** need to be addressed.
- **Governance mechanisms** are needed to prevent reviewer fatigue and ensure qualified approvers for mutations.

Overall, the framework is feasible if implemented in phases, with a strong focus on the most critical safety features first.

## 2. The [4] Pillars: Technical Specifications

### Pillar 1: Trinity Safety Validator

This pillar defines the core safety validation logic that will be used to assess the risk of a proposed evolution.

#### 1.1. The Trinity Safety Equation: `f(τ, σ, φ)`

The safety of a mutation will be determined by a weighted score, calculated as follows:

`SafetyScore = (w_τ * (1 - τ_norm)) + (w_σ * σ_norm) + (w_φ * φ_delta_norm)`

- **`τ_norm`**: The normalized Tau score (system complexity) after the proposed mutation. Normalized to a 0-1 range, where 1 is high complexity.
- **`σ_norm`**: The normalized Sigma score (collaborative efficiency) after the proposed mutation. Normalized to a 0-1 range, where 1 is high efficiency.
- **`φ_delta_norm`**: The normalized change in the Phi score (code quality). `φ_new - φ_old`, normalized to a -1 to 1 range. Positive values indicate an improvement in quality.
- **`w_τ`, `w_σ`, `w_φ`**: Configurable weights for each metric. Default values will be `w_τ=0.5`, `w_σ=0.3`, `w_φ=0.2`.

#### 1.2. Implementation Details

- A new class, `TrinitySafetyValidator`, will be created.
- It will have a method, `validate(mutation)`, that takes a proposed mutation as input.
- This method will first create a temporary, sandboxed version of the component with the mutation applied.
- It will then calculate the new τ, σ, and φ scores for the sandboxed component.
- It will use the formula above to calculate the `SafetyScore`.
- If `SafetyScore` is above a configurable threshold (e.g., 0.7), the validation passes.

#### 1.3. Capturing the φ Baseline

To calculate `φ_delta_norm`, we need a baseline `φ` score. Before any mutation is proposed, a snapshot of the component's current `φ` score will be taken and stored as part of the component's metadata.

---

### Pillar 2: Pre-Evolution Trinity Check

This pillar describes how the `SafeEvolutionController` will use the `TrinitySafetyValidator` and `EvolutionBounds` to perform pre-flight checks.

#### 2.1. Workflow

1.  A mutation is proposed to the `SafeEvolutionController`.
2.  The controller first checks the mutation against the `EvolutionBounds` for the component's ATCG type.
3.  If the mutation is within the allowed bounds, the controller then calls the `TrinitySafetyValidator`.
4.  If both checks pass, the mutation proceeds to the next stage (e.g., human approval or sandboxed testing).

#### 2.2. `SafeEvolutionController` Refinement

The `propose_evolution` method of the `SafeEvolutionController` will be updated as follows:

```python
async def propose_evolution(self, component, mutation):
    # 1. Bounds checking
    if not self.evolution_bounds.is_within_limits(mutation):
        return EvolutionResult.REJECTED_BOUNDS

    # 2. Pre-Evolution Trinity Check
    trinity_check_passed, trinity_score = await self.trinity_validator.validate(mutation)
    if not trinity_check_passed:
        return EvolutionResult.REJECTED_TRINITY_CHECK

    # 3. Safety validation (the more detailed checks)
    safety_score = await self.safety_validator.assess(mutation)
    if safety_score < SAFETY_THRESHOLD:
        return EvolutionResult.REJECTED_SAFETY

    # ... rest of the process
```

---

### Pillar 3: Post-Evolution Trinity Monitoring

This pillar details the implementation of the `AutoRollbackMonitor`, which will continuously monitor the health of a component after a mutation has been applied.

#### 3.1. Implementation Details

- A new class, `AutoRollbackMonitor`, will be created.
- When a mutation is successfully deployed, the `SafeEvolutionController` will register the component and the mutation ID with the `AutoRollbackMonitor`.
- The monitor will run in a background task, periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds) re-calculating the Trinity Safety Score (`f(τ, σ, φ)`) for the component.
- If the score drops below a pre-defined "critical" threshold for a sustained period (e.g., 3 consecutive checks), the monitor will trigger an automatic rollback.

#### 3.2. Cooldown Mechanism

To prevent rollback loops, after a rollback is triggered for a component, that component will be placed in a "cooldown" state for a configurable period (e.g., 1 hour). No new mutations will be allowed for that component during the cooldown period.

#### 3.3. State Management

The `AutoRollbackMonitor` will maintain a dictionary of monitored components, their baseline scores, and their current health status.

---

### Pillar 4: Living Buildings Integration

This pillar describes the user interface and dashboard for monitoring and governing the auto-evolution process. This is the "Living Buildings" aspect, where we make the evolution process observable and controllable.

#### 4.1. Evolution Dashboard

A new page will be added to the Hive's frontend dashboard with the following sections:

- **Active Evolutions:** A list of all components currently undergoing evolution, with their current stage (e.g., "validating", "pending approval", "monitoring").
- **Pending Approvals:** A queue of mutations that require human approval. This section will display the details of the mutation, the risk assessment, and buttons to approve or reject.
- **Evolution History:** A log of all past evolution attempts, both successful and failed. This will be powered by the `ComponentGenealogy` system.
- **System Health:** Real-time charts showing the overall Trinity Safety Score of the Hive, as well as the individual τ, σ, and φ metrics.

#### 4.2. Human Approval Workflow

- When a mutation requires human approval, a new item will be added to the "Pending Approvals" queue.
- Designated human operators (with the `evolution_approver` role) will be able to view the details of the proposed mutation.
- The `HumanApprovalGateway` will expose an API endpoint that the frontend can call to submit an approval or rejection.

#### 4.3. Emergency Kill Switch

The dashboard will include a prominent, but well-protected, "Emergency Kill Switch" button. Activating this switch will immediately halt all in-progress evolutions and trigger a rollback of any recently completed ones. Access to this button will be restricted to the `hive_admin` role.

## 3. The [7] Sacred Safeguards: Implementation Plan

### Safeguard 1: Evolution Bounds Enforcement

This is the first and most important line of defense. It ensures that no mutation can violate the fundamental constraints of a component's ATCG type.

#### 1.1. Technical Architecture

- A new file, `hive/evolution/bounds.py`, will be created to house the `EvolutionBounds` class.
- The `EvolutionBounds` class will load its configuration from a YAML file, `config/evolution_bounds.yaml`. This allows us to update the bounds without changing the code.
- The `is_within_limits` method will be the core of this safeguard. It will take a mutation object as input and check it against the loaded bounds.

#### 1.2. Integration Points

- The `SafeEvolutionController` will be the primary consumer of the `EvolutionBounds` service. It will call `is_within_limits` at the very beginning of the `propose_evolution` workflow.

#### 1.3. Monitoring and Alerting

- Any mutation that is rejected for being out of bounds will generate a `PollenEvent` of type `EvolutionOutOfBoundsRejected`.
- This event will be logged to the Structured Audit Logger with a `warning` level.

#### 1.4. Failure Modes and Recovery

- **Failure Mode:** The `evolution_bounds.yaml` file is missing or malformed.
- **Recovery:** The `EvolutionBounds` class will fail to initialize, and the `SafeEvolutionController` will enter a "safe mode" where all mutations are rejected. An alert will be sent to the human operators.

---

### Safeguard 2: Multi-Layered Safety Validation

This safeguard performs a deep analysis of the proposed mutation to assess its impact on the system.

#### 2.1. Technical Architecture

- A new directory, `hive/evolution/validators/`, will be created.
- Each validator (e.g., `performance_validator.py`, `security_validator.py`) will be a separate class in this directory, inheriting from a common `AbstractValidator`.
- The `SafetyValidator` class will be responsible for discovering and running all available validators.
- Each validator will return a score from 0.0 to 1.0.

#### 2.2. Integration Points

- The `SafeEvolutionController` will call the `SafetyValidator` after the bounds check has passed.

#### 2.3. Monitoring and Alerting

- The results of each individual validator will be logged.
- If the final, aggregated safety score is below the threshold, a `PollenEvent` of type `EvolutionSafetyValidationFailed` will be generated.

#### 2.4. Failure Modes and Recovery

- **Failure Mode:** A validator crashes or times out.
- **Recovery:** The `SafetyValidator` will treat a crashed validator as a score of 0.0, effectively failing the validation and preventing the mutation from proceeding.

---

### Safeguard 3: Human-in-the-Loop Approval Gates

This safeguard ensures that significant mutations are reviewed and approved by a human operator.

#### 3.1. Technical Architecture

- A new class, `HumanApprovalGateway`, will be created in `hive/evolution/governance.py`.
- It will maintain a queue of pending approvals in a database table.
- It will expose API endpoints for listing pending approvals and for submitting an approval or rejection.

#### 3.2. Integration Points

- The `SafeEvolutionController` will call the `HumanApprovalGateway` if the `TrinitySafetyValidator` determines that human approval is required.
- The frontend `EvolutionDashboard` will use the new API endpoints to display the pending approvals and allow operators to take action.

#### 3.3. Monitoring and Alerting

- When a new mutation is added to the approval queue, a `PollenEvent` of type `EvolutionApprovalRequired` will be generated.
- This can be used to trigger notifications (e.g., via email or chat) to the designated approvers.

#### 3.4. Failure Modes and Recovery

- **Failure Mode:** An approval request is not acted upon within a certain time frame.
- **Recovery:** The request will time out and be automatically rejected. The timeout period will be configurable.

---

### Safeguard 4: Automatic Rollback Triggers

This safeguard provides a safety net by automatically reverting mutations that cause problems after they have been deployed.

#### 4.1. Technical Architecture

- A new class, `AutoRollbackMonitor`, will be created in `hive/evolution/monitoring.py`.
- It will run as a background task, continuously monitoring the health of recently evolved components.
- The monitoring will be based on the same Trinity Safety Score used for pre-evolution validation.

#### 4.2. Integration Points

- The `SafeEvolutionController` will register a component with the `AutoRollbackMonitor` after a mutation has been successfully deployed.
- If a rollback is triggered, the `AutoRollbackMonitor` will call the `RollbackManager` (from Safeguard 6) to perform the rollback.

#### 4.3. Monitoring and Alerting

- When a rollback is triggered, a `PollenEvent` of type `EvolutionRolledBack` will be generated with a `critical` severity.
- This will trigger an immediate alert to the human operators.

#### 4.4. Failure Modes and Recovery

- **Failure Mode:** The `AutoRollbackMonitor` itself crashes.
- **Recovery:** The monitor will be supervised by the main Hive Host process and will be automatically restarted if it fails.

---

### Safeguard 5: Emergency Kill Switch Protocol

This is the ultimate safeguard, providing a way for human operators to immediately halt all evolution in the case of an emergency.

#### 5.1. Technical Architecture

- A new class, `EvolutionKillSwitch`, will be created in `hive/evolution/governance.py`.
- It will maintain a global state (e.g., in a Redis cache or a database) that indicates whether the kill switch is active.
- The `SafeEvolutionController` will check the state of the kill switch before proposing any new mutation.

#### 5.2. Integration Points

- The frontend `EvolutionDashboard` will have a button to activate the kill switch.
- This button will call a new API endpoint that activates the `EvolutionKillSwitch`.

#### 5.3. Monitoring and Alerting

- When the kill switch is activated, a `PollenEvent` of type `EvolutionKillSwitchActivated` will be generated with a `critical` severity.
- This will trigger an immediate, high-priority alert to all operators.

#### 5.4. Failure Modes and Recovery

- **Failure Mode:** The kill switch mechanism itself fails.
- **Recovery:** As a last resort, the entire `SafeEvolutionController` can be disabled via a configuration flag and a system restart.

---

### Safeguard 6: Genetic Lineage Tracking

This safeguard provides the history and traceability needed for manual and automatic rollbacks.

#### 6.1. Technical Architecture

- A new class, `ComponentGenealogy`, will be created in `hive/evolution/lineage.py`.
- It will store the evolution history of each component in a new database table, `evolution_log`.
- For each evolution, it will store a snapshot of the component's code (or a git commit hash) and its state.

#### 6.2. Integration Points

- The `SafeEvolutionController` will call the `ComponentGenealogy` service to record a new evolution step after a mutation has been successfully deployed.
- The `RollbackManager` (part of this safeguard) will use the `ComponentGenealogy` service to retrieve the previous version of a component for rollback.

#### 6.3. Monitoring and Alerting

- The size of the `evolution_log` table will be monitored to prevent unbounded growth.

#### 6.4. Failure Modes and Recovery

- **Failure Mode:** The database connection is lost.
- **Recovery:** The `ComponentGenealogy` service will fail gracefully, and the evolution will be rejected. No new evolutions will be allowed until the database connection is restored.

---

### Safeguard 7: Sacred Team Consensus Requirement

This is a governance safeguard that ensures that the most critical mutations are approved by a consensus of the Sacred Team.

#### 7.1. Technical Architecture

- A new class, `TeamConsensusEngine`, will be created in `hive/evolution/governance.py`.
- It will be integrated with the `HumanApprovalGateway`.
- For mutations that are flagged as requiring team consensus, the gateway will call the `TeamConsensusEngine`.

#### 7.2. Integration Points

- The `HumanApprovalGateway` will be the primary consumer of this service.
- The `TeamConsensusEngine` will use the `HiveRegistry` to get the list of current Sacred Team members.

#### 7.3. Monitoring and Alerting

- When a consensus vote is initiated, all members of the Sacred Team will be notified.
- If a vote is not completed within a certain time frame, it will time out and be automatically rejected.

#### 7.4. Failure Modes and Recovery

- **Failure Mode:** A consensus cannot be reached (e.g., a tie vote).
- **Recovery:** The mutation will be rejected. It can be re-proposed after further discussion and refinement.

## 4. Conclusion

This document provides the complete technical foundation for the Safe AutoEvolution Framework. With the approval of the Sacred Team, we can begin the implementation of this core component of the Hive's "Living Application" vision.

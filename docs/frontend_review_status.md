### Pending Issues from Previous Reviews

The following issues from the comprehensive frontend review remain as improvement opportunities for future PRs:

## Commit: `7cee2ce feat(frontend): Implement Journey view with interactive hexa levels`

### File: `frontend/src/views/JourneyView.vue`

1.  **SVG Embedding:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The SVG is still directly embedded.
    *   **Notes:** The suggestion to create a dedicated `JourneyMap.vue` component that takes `levels` data as a prop and dynamically renders the SVG elements is still valid.

2.  **Hardcoded SVG Coordinates:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `points`, `x`, and `y` attributes for each `HexaLevel` are still hardcoded.
    *   **Notes:** Dynamic calculation of SVG coordinates based on responsive design principles is still a valid improvement.

3.  **`getHexClass` Logic Duplication:**
    *   **Status:** Implemented. The `getHexClass` and `isLevelSolved` functions were removed from `JourneyView.vue` in a previous step (during the build fix).
    *   **Notes:** This issue is resolved.

4.  **Organella Icon Rendering:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `getOrganellaIcon` in `HexaLevel.vue` still generates a data URI for an SVG containing an emoji.
    *   **Notes:** A dedicated icon component or a more robust SVG sprite system is still a valid improvement.

### File: `frontend/src/components/HexaLevel.vue`

1.  **Tight Coupling to `chatStore`:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `HexaLevel` component still directly accesses `chatStore.level`.
    *   **Notes:** Passing the `currentLevel` status as a prop from `JourneyView.vue` to `HexaLevel.vue` is still a valid improvement.

2.  **`selectLevel` Placeholder:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `selectLevel` method is still a `TODO`.
    *   **Notes:** Emitting an event to the parent `JourneyView` to handle level selection is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Organella Icon Positioning:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `x` and `y` coordinates for organella icons are still hardcoded.
    *   **Notes:** Implementing a more robust layout algorithm within `HexaLevel` or a sub-component to position organellas dynamically is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `5339434 fix(frontend): Add missing properties to challenges`

### File: `frontend/src/challenges/index.ts`

1.  **Hardcoded Skill Data:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `skillDomains`, `skillUnlocks`, `atcgSequence`, and `difficultyTier` are still hardcoded directly within the `challenges` array. (This file was reverted, so the properties are not present, but the underlying issue of hardcoding remains if they are reintroduced).
    *   **Notes:** Separating the challenge content from the skill-related metadata is still a valid improvement.

2.  **`skillUnlocks` as an Array of `SkillUnlock`:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. (This file was reverted, so the properties are not present, but the underlying issue of complex `SkillUnlock` definitions remains if they are reintroduced).
    *   **Notes:** Defining `SkillUnlock` objects centrally and having challenges refer to them by name is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Lack of Validation/Schema Enforcement:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. (This file was reverted, so the properties are not present, but the underlying issue of lack of validation remains if they are reintroduced).
    *   **Notes:** Implementing runtime validation or leveraging TypeScript's type checking more rigorously is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `6d32e9c feat(frontend): Implement interactive grimoire`

### File: `frontend/src/components/OrganellaPanel.vue`

1.  **Reactivity with `Map`:**
    *   **Status:** Implemented. This was fixed during the build fix.
    *   **Notes:** This issue is resolved.

2.  **Timer Management:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `setTimeout` is still managed directly within the component.
    *   **Notes:** Using Vue's lifecycle hooks to manage timers is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Hardcoded Study Duration:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The 3-minute (180000 ms) study duration is still hardcoded.
    *   **Notes:** Defining the duration as a constant, a prop, or fetching it from a configuration store is still a valid improvement.

### File: `frontend/src/stores/chat.ts`

1.  **Data Structure for `sacred_skills`:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `Organella` interface still includes `sacred_skills` as `Record<string, string>`.
    *   **Notes:** Using a more specific interface for `SacredSkill` is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Grimoire Content Management:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Grimoire content is still directly within the `Organella` interface.
    *   **Notes:** Considering a separate `grimoire.ts` store is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `bec8988 feat(frontend): Display grimoire information in OrganellaPanel`

### File: `frontend/src/components/OrganellaPanel.vue`

1.  **Direct Display of Grimoire Content:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `OrganellaPanel` still directly displays the `mystical_appearance` and `sacred_skills` from the `organella` prop.
    *   **Notes:** Creating a dedicated `GrimoireSection.vue` component is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Styling of Grimoire Sections:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The styling for `organella-appearance` and `organella-sacred-skills` is still directly in `OrganellaPanel.vue`'s style block.
    *   **Notes:** Moving the styling into a dedicated `GrimoireSection.vue` component is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Accessibility of "Study" Button:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The "Study" button still has accessibility issues.
    *   **Notes:** Implementing ARIA attributes and providing visual feedback is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `75a1c69 feat(frontend): Modernize message bubbles`

### File: `frontend/src/assets/base.css`

1.  **Global CSS for Component-Specific Styling:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Component-specific styles are still in `base.css`.
    *   **Notes:** Encapsulating message bubble styling within a dedicated `MessageBubble.vue` component using `<style scoped>` is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Hardcoded Colors/Gradients:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The gradients and colors are still hardcoded with specific hex values.
    *   **Notes:** Utilizing CSS variables (custom properties) for colors and gradients is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Lack of Theming Integration:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The changes introduce new colors without explicitly integrating them into a theming system.
    *   **Notes:** Ensuring new styles are compatible with or integrated into the existing theming mechanism is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `dc78443 refactor(frontend): Move collapsible styles to global stylesheet`

### File: `frontend/src/assets/base.css`

1.  **Global Styles for Component-Specific Behavior:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Styles for collapsible content are still in `base.css`.
    *   **Notes:** Creating a reusable `CollapsibleContainer.vue` component that encapsulates both the HTML structure and the CSS for collapsible content is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Lack of Theming for Collapsible States:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The styles for `.collapsed` and `.expanded` states might not inherently adapt to different themes.
    *   **Notes:** Ensuring that any colors or background properties used in the collapsible styles are defined using CSS variables is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Potential for Over-specificity/Conflicts:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Moving these to global `base.css` increases the risk of unintended style application or conflicts.
    *   **Notes:** Using more specific class names or BEM conventions if global styles are unavoidable is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `5762c05 fix(frontend): Reduce default size of collapsed images`

### File: `frontend/src/assets/base.css`

1.  **Global Styling for Specific Content Type:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Image-specific styles are still within `base.css`.
    *   **Notes:** Creating a dedicated component (e.g., `CollapsibleImage.vue`) that encapsulates both the image and its collapsible behavior, along with its specific styling, is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Hardcoded Dimensions:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `100px` dimensions are still hardcoded.
    *   **Notes:** Using CSS variables for dimensions is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Responsiveness:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The fixed `100px` might not be ideal for all screen sizes.
    *   **Notes:** Considering relative units or a more sophisticated responsive image solution is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `7209012 feat(frontend): Replace favicon with hive-themed SVG`

### File: `frontend/index.html`

1.  **SVG as `.ico`:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The SVG is still referenced as `.ico`.
    *   **Notes:** Providing multiple favicon formats for broader compatibility is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Favicon Location:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The SVG is still placed in `/public/favicon.ico`.
    *   **Notes:** Naming the SVG file with its correct extension (`.svg`) and updating the `href` in `index.html` accordingly is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `30c8be1 feat(frontend): Add OrganellaPanel to the chat view`

### File: `frontend/src/App.vue`

1.  **Unconditional Rendering in `App.vue`:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. `OrganellaPanel` is still rendered unconditionally.
    *   **Notes:** Using conditional rendering (`v-if`) based on the current route or other application state is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Layout Management:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Directly embedding `OrganellaPanel` might make layout management more complex.
    *   **Notes:** Defining a clear layout structure within `App.vue` and placing `OrganellaPanel` within a designated layout slot is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `3dfa003 feat(frontend): Add born animation to organellas`

### File: `frontend/src/components/OrganellaPanel.vue`

1.  **Animation Triggering:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The animation is still applied directly to `.organella-card`.
    *   **Notes:** Controlling the animation trigger more precisely is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Animation Performance/Customization:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Directly applying `@keyframes` to a large number of elements might have performance implications.
    *   **Notes:** Ensuring animations use `transform` and `opacity` properties where possible is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Animation Duration/Timing:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `0.5s` duration is still fixed.
    *   **Notes:** Defining animation properties (duration, easing) using CSS variables is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `4ec1a8c fix(frontend): Fix TypeScript error in OrganellaPanel`

### File: `frontend/src/components/OrganellaPanel.vue`

1.  **Magic Number `100` for XP:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The number `100` is still used as a magic number for XP per level.
    *   **Notes:** Defining `XP_PER_LEVEL` as a named constant or fetching it from a configuration store is still a valid improvement.

2.  **`getXpProgress` Location:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `getXpProgress` function is still within `OrganellaPanel.vue`.
    *   **Notes:** Extracting utility functions into a separate utility file is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `4a8ae19 feat(frontend): Add born and dance animations to image organellas`

### File: `frontend/src/components/DigitalBee.vue`

1.  **CSS-Only Animation Control:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Animations are still controlled solely through CSS classes.
    *   **Notes:** Using a JavaScript-based animation library for more dynamic and interactive animations is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Hardcoded Animation Properties:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Animation durations, timings, and specific keyframe values are still hardcoded within the CSS.
    *   **Notes:** Defining animation properties using CSS variables is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Accessibility:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. While animations enhance visual appeal, ensure they don't hinder accessibility.
    *   **Notes:** Providing a mechanism for users to disable or reduce animations, respecting the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query, is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `5f2591d fix(frontend): Ensure all messages have collapsible content`

### File: `frontend/src/App.vue`

1.  **Universal Collapsibility:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Applying collapsibility to *all* messages might not always be desirable.
    *   **Notes:** Implementing conditional collapsibility based on message content, type, or length is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Performance Overhead:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. If every message is wrapped in a collapsible component, there might be a slight performance overhead.
    *   **Notes:** Optimizing the `CollapsibleContainer` component for performance is still a valid improvement.

3.  **User Experience:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Forcing collapsibility on all messages might negatively impact the user experience.
    *   **Notes:** Conducting user testing to determine the optimal balance between message visibility and collapsibility is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `1e1f3b9 fix(frontend): Improve color contrast in dark theme`

### File: `frontend/src/assets/base.css`

1.  **Manual Color Adjustments:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Relying on manual adjustments for color contrast can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
    *   **Notes:** Implementing a systematic approach to color management (design tokens, automated contrast checking, pre-defined accessible palettes) is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Limited Scope of Fix:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The commit focuses on `base.css`.
    *   **Notes:** Enforcing the use of CSS variables (design tokens) for all color-related properties across the entire codebase is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Lack of Documentation for Color System:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Without clear documentation, it can be difficult for new developers to understand the color system.
    *   **Notes:** Creating a dedicated section in the project's documentation that outlines the color palette, its usage, and guidelines for ensuring accessibility is still a valid improvement.

## Commit: `2c82f18 fix(frontend): Resolve TypeScript compilation errors for Gemini integration`

### File: `frontend/src/stores/chat.ts`

1.  **Tight Coupling to Backend API:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. TypeScript types are directly mirroring backend API responses.
    *   **Notes:** Considering a dedicated API layer for type definitions and transformations is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Lack of Centralized Type Definitions:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. New types related to Gemini or other backend integrations are scattered across different store files.
    *   **Notes:** Centralizing common or backend-related type definitions in a dedicated `types` directory is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Error Handling for Type Mismatches:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Runtime data might not always conform to defined types.
    *   **Notes:** Implementing runtime validation for data received from external sources is still a valid improvement.

## Uncommitted Changes Review: Frontend Files

### File: `frontend/src/App.vue` (Unstaged Modification)

1.  **Monolithic Layout Component:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. `App.vue` has become very large and complex.
    *   **Notes:** Breaking down `App.vue` into smaller, more focused components is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Tight Coupling to `chatStore`:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `App.vue` component directly accesses many properties and actions from `chatStore`.
    *   **Notes:** Passing necessary data as props to child components, and emitting events for actions that affect global state, is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Extensive Scoped Styles:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The sheer volume of CSS within `App.vue` makes it difficult to manage.
    *   **Notes:** Centralizing design tokens, using utility classes, and moving component-specific styles into their respective components is still a valid improvement.

4.  **Sidebar Collapse Logic:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `isCollapsed` state and `toggleSidebar` function are managed directly in `App.vue`.
    *   **Notes:** Managing sidebar state in a dedicated Pinia store is still a valid improvement.

5.  **Accessibility of Collapsible Sidebar:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `visibility: hidden` for collapsed elements might not be ideal for accessibility.
    *   **Notes:** Using `display: none` or `aria-hidden="true"` for truly hidden content is still a valid improvement.

6.  **Hardcoded Router Links:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `RouterLink` paths are hardcoded.
    *   **Notes:** Using named routes for better maintainability is still a valid improvement.

### File: `frontend/src/challenges/index.ts` (Unstaged Modification - Reverted State)

1.  **Lack of Gamification Properties:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The absence of `skillDomains`, `skillUnlocks`, `atcgSequence`, and `difficultyTier` means the challenges cannot fully integrate with the planned gamification system.
    *   **Notes:** Reintroducing these properties and considering the modularization and data management strategies proposed in the previous review for `5339434` is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Hardcoded Challenge Data:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The challenge content is still hardcoded directly within the `challenges` array.
    *   **Notes:** Separating challenge content from metadata is still a valid improvement.

3.  **No Centralized Skill Definitions:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `SkillDomain`, `ATCGPhase`, and `SkillUnlock` definitions are missing.
    *   **Notes:** Defining these enums and interfaces centrally and managing skill definitions in a dedicated module is still a valid improvement.

4.  **Lack of Validation/Schema Enforcement:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The need for validation remains.
    *   **Notes:** Implementing runtime validation is still a valid improvement.

### File: `frontend/src/components/OrganellaPanel.vue` (Unstaged Modification - Reverted State)

1.  **Reactivity with `Map`:**
    *   **Status:** Implemented. This was fixed during the build fix.
    *   **Notes:** This issue is resolved.

2.  **Timer Management:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `setTimeout` is still managed directly within the component.
    *   **Notes:** Using Vue's lifecycle hooks to manage timers is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Hardcoded Study Duration:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The 3-minute (180000 ms) study duration is still hardcoded.
    *   **Notes:** Defining the duration as a constant, a prop, or fetching it from a configuration store is still a valid improvement.

4.  **Data Structure for `sacred_skills` (now `experience`):**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `experience` section is now displayed, but the original intent was to display `sacred_skills`.
    *   **Notes:** If `experience` needs to be more detailed, consider a more specific interface.

5.  **Grimoire Content Management:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Grimoire content is still directly within the `Organella` interface.
    *   **Notes:** Considering a separate `grimoire.ts` store is still a valid improvement.

6.  **Direct Display of Grimoire Content:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `OrganellaPanel` still directly displays the grimoire content.
    *   **Notes:** Creating a dedicated `GrimoireSection.vue` component is still a valid improvement.

7.  **Styling of Grimoire Sections:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The styling for grimoire sections is still directly in `OrganellaPanel.vue`'s style block.
    *   **Notes:** Moving the styling into a dedicated `GrimoireSection.vue` component is still a valid improvement.

8.  **Accessibility of "Study" Button:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The "Study" button still has accessibility issues.
    *   **Notes:** Implementing ARIA attributes and providing visual feedback is still a valid improvement.

9.  **`getConsciousnessLevel` Function:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. This new function calculates a consciousness level.
    *   **Notes:** Location, input type, and magic number issues are still valid.

### File: `frontend/src/components/BeeOrganella.vue` (Untracked File)

1.  **SVG Symbol Definition Location:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Defining multiple `<symbol>` elements directly within the component's template.
    *   **Notes:** Extracting the SVG `<symbol>` definitions into a separate SVG sprite file is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Hardcoded Animation Speeds:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `flap-fast`, `flap-normal`, and `flap-slow` classes have hardcoded animation durations.
    *   **Notes:** Using a CSS variable for the animation duration and dynamically binding its value is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Color Management:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Colors are defined as computed properties and then bound to CSS variables.
    *   **Notes:** Defining bee-specific colors as CSS variables in a global stylesheet or theme file is still a valid improvement.

4.  **Accessibility:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The SVG has a `<title>` element, which is good.
    *   **Notes:** Ensuring all interactive elements within the SVG have appropriate ARIA roles and labels is still a valid improvement.

5.  **Responsiveness of `width`/`height`:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `width: 50px; height: 50px;` sets a fixed size.
    *   **Notes:** Using relative units for the base `width` and `height` is still a valid improvement.

### File: `frontend/src/components/DigitalBee.vue` (Untracked File)

1.  **SVG Structure and Reusability:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The entire SVG structure is embedded directly in the component.
    *   **Notes:** Extracting the base SVG structure into a reusable SVG sprite file is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Color Management:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Colors are passed as individual props and then bound to CSS variables.
    *   **Notes:** Considering a `theme` prop that maps to a predefined set of colors is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Animation Control and Flexibility:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `animationSpeed` prop maps to hardcoded durations.
    *   **Notes:** For more granular control, pass the animation duration directly as a CSS variable is still a valid improvement.

4.  **Accessibility:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The SVG lacks a `<title>` or `<desc>` element for accessibility.
    *   **Notes:** Adding `role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` attributes, linking to `<title>` and `<desc>` elements within the SVG is still a valid improvement.

5.  **Stinger and Sword Conditional Rendering:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `stingerColor` prop implies that the stinger is only present if a color is provided.
    *   **Notes:** Using a dedicated `hasStinger` boolean prop for clarity is still a valid improvement.

### File: `frontend/src/components/GenesisContainer.vue` (Untracked File)

1.  **Static Nature vs. "Genesis" Intent:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The component is currently static.
    *   **Notes:** If this component is meant to be interactive or reflect state, it should accept props to control the appearance or animation of the primitives.

2.  **Hardcoded Colors:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Colors for the primitives and the hexagon are hardcoded in the `<style scoped>` block.
    *   **Notes:** Defining colors using CSS variables in a global stylesheet or theme file is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Lack of Responsiveness for Fixed Size:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `width: 150px; height: 150px;` sets a fixed size.
    *   **Notes:** Using relative units for `width` and `height` is still a valid improvement.

4.  **Accessibility:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The SVG lacks a `<title>` or `<desc>` element for accessibility.
    *   **Notes:** Adding `role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` attributes, linking to `<title>` and `<desc>` elements within the SVG is still a valid improvement.

### File: `frontend/src/components/HeroMessage.vue` (Untracked File)

1.  **Tight Coupling to `SvgHero` Props:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `HeroMessage` component directly passes all `heroProperties` to `SvgHero`.
    *   **Notes:** Using `v-bind="heroProperties"` to pass all properties from `heroProperties` directly to `SvgHero` is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Dialogue Bubble Styling:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The speech bubble triangle is created using a `::before` pseudo-element with hardcoded positioning and color.
    *   **Notes:** Using CSS variables for the background color of the dialogue bubble and the border color of the `::before` pseudo-element is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Fixed Avatar Size:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `hero-avatar` has a fixed `width: 80px; height: 104px;`.
    *   **Notes:** Using relative units for the `width` and `height` to make the avatar more responsive is still a valid improvement.

4.  **Accessibility:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The component displays a visual character and dialogue.
    *   **Notes:** Ensuring the `SvgHero` component itself has proper accessibility attributes is still a valid improvement.

### File: `frontend/src/components/InteractiveCodeBlock.vue` (Untracked File)

1.  **CodeMirror Integration:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The integration directly uses `EditorView` and `basicSetup`.
    *   **Notes:** Creating a dedicated `CodeEditor.vue` component that wraps CodeMirror is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Global `pythonRunner` I/O Handlers:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `pythonRunner.setIoHandlers` is called unconditionally on `onMounted`.
    *   **Notes:** Passing the I/O handlers directly to the `pythonRunner.run` method is still a valid improvement.

3.  **`runChallenge` for Free-form Code:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Using `pythonRunner.runChallenge` with dummy test cases for free-form code execution is a workaround.
    *   **Notes:** Introducing a dedicated `runFreeform` method in `pythonRunner.ts` is still a valid improvement.

4.  **Output Display:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The output is displayed in a raw `<pre>` tag.
    *   **Notes:** Creating a dedicated `CodeOutput.vue` component that can parse the output is still a valid improvement.

5.  **Accessibility:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The "Run Code" button should have an `aria-label` for better accessibility.
    *   **Notes:** Adding `aria-label` to the button is still a valid improvement.

### File: `frontend/src/components/RoomNavigation.vue` (Untracked File)

1.  **Direct `Room` Type Import:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The component directly imports `Room` interface from `@/stores/chat`.
    *   **Notes:** Centralizing common interfaces in a dedicated `types` directory is still a valid improvement.

2.  **"Create Room" Button State:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The "Create Room" button is `disabled` and has a hardcoded `title="Coming soon"`.
    *   **Notes:** Managing the `disabled` state and `title` dynamically using reactive variables or computed properties is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Hardcoded Room Types:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `room-type` classes have hardcoded background and text colors.
    *   **Notes:** Defining these colors as CSS variables in a global stylesheet or theme file is still a valid improvement.

4.  **Custom Scrollbar Styling:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The custom scrollbar styling can be inconsistent and potentially problematic for accessibility.
    *   **Notes:** Evaluating the necessity of custom scrollbars and ensuring thorough cross-browser testing is still a valid improvement.

5.  **`createRoom` Placeholder:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `createRoom` function is a `TODO`.
    *   **Notes:** Implementing the `createRoom` logic is still a valid improvement.

### File: `frontend/src/components/TeammatePresence.vue` (Untracked File)

1.  **Direct `HiveTeammate` Type Import:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The component directly imports `HiveTeammate` interface from `@/stores/chat`.
    *   **Notes:** Centralizing common interfaces in a dedicated `types` directory is still a valid improvement.

2.  **Hardcoded Icons for Teammate Types:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `getTeammateIcon` function uses a hardcoded mapping of teammate types to emoji icons.
    *   **Notes:** Defining the icon mapping in a separate configuration file or a store is still a valid improvement.

3.  **Hardcoded Health Percentages:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The `getHealthPercentage` function uses a hardcoded mapping of health statuses to percentages.
    *   **Notes:** Defining the health percentage mapping in a separate configuration file or a store is still a valid improvement.

4.  **Limited Capability Display:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Only the first three capabilities are displayed.
    *   **Notes:** Considering a tooltip or a modal that displays all capabilities is still a valid improvement.

5.  **Custom Scrollbar Styling:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. The custom scrollbar styling can be inconsistent and potentially problematic for accessibility.
    *   **Notes:** Evaluating the necessity of custom scrollbars and ensuring thorough cross-browser testing is still a valid improvement.

6.  **Accessibility:**
    *   **Status:** Actual. Ensure that the status indicators and health bars are accessible to screen readers.
    *   **Notes:** Using `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` attributes to provide descriptive text is still a valid improvement.

## Summary of `docs/frontend_review_summary.md`

The `docs/frontend_review_summary.md` provides a high-level overview of the key findings and recommendations. Based on the detailed status review, almost all the issues identified in the summary are still `Actual`. The only issues that have been `Implemented` are:

*   **`getHexClass` Logic Duplication** in `frontend/src/views/JourneyView.vue`
*   **Reactivity with `Map`** in `frontend/src/components/OrganellaPanel.vue`

This means that the recommendations in `docs/frontend_review_summary.md` are still highly relevant and should be pursued.
